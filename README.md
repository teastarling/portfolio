# Portfolio

*Website showcasing recent work with main sections spaced and situated within "grid" areas in order to align all content properly. Project Images feature fading opacity on hover, and hero text is tinted with linear gradients for a more engaging appearance. Media Query used to scale down site for smaller screen/browser sizes so elements remain visible and viable.
